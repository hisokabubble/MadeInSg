MadeInSG project

360 virtual tour of Singapore Zoo.

Key Controls, only the VR Joystick is needed.

For the Enclosure area, just walk around using the joysticks to enjoy the view, learn more about each animal.
Player will need to walk up to each enclosure for a informative UI to pop up.

For the bear game, just wait for the initial countdown to end until the bear spawns.
When the bear spawns, run away from the bear all while collecting the fishes collectable to earn points.
The bear's speed will increase every second, so it will catch up eventually.
Goal of the game is to collect as many fishes as possible while avoiding the bear.

Some bugs:
The bear's navmesh AI is buggy due to the terrain, so the tracking and chasing of player is not exactly the best.
The bear lacks a running animation.

Platform required:
Just a VR Headset.
Player is required to standstill and only use the joysticks to move, instead of running in real life to avoid injuries.
